Demos for first steps of I/O via files

Contents:
=========
 - FileIO_a.cpp: Replace cin/cout streams by infile/outfile.
 - FileIO_b.cpp: similar to 'a' but with pointers to streams 
                 allowing to switch between standard I/O and file I/O.
 - FileIO_c.cpp: as 'b' with a simple parser to extract options from the command line arguments
 - FileIO_d.cpp: as 'c' but with foolproof opening of file streams
