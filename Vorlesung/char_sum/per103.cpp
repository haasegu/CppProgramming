/*
Let's all go out and give them 103%.

100% 

We have all been to those meetings where someone wants more than 100%.  Well
here's how you do that.  Here's how you can achieve 103%.

First of all, here's a little math that might prove helpful in the future.
How does one achieve 100% in LIFE?  Begin by noting the following.
