/*
Let's all go out and give them 103%.

100% 

We have all been to those meetings where someone wants more than 100%.  Well
here's how you do that.  Here's how you can achieve 103%.

First of all, here's a little math that might prove helpful in the future.
How does one achieve 100% in LIFE?  Begin by noting the following.

#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char term[30];
    
  cout << endl;
  cout << " How to get 103% performance? " << endl << endl;
  cout << "  Try it with :  ";
  cin  >> term;
  
  int sum = 0;
  for (unsigned int i=0; i<strlen(term); ++i)
   {
     sum += term[i]-96;
   }
    
  cout << endl << endl;
  cout << "  " << term << "  performs with  " << sum << "%" << endl << endl;















  
//   cout << endl;
//   cout << " How to get 103% performance? " << endl << endl;
//   
//   cout << " by :  H A R D W O R K     = " <<  H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K   << " %" << endl;
//   
// //	Similarly, 
//   cout << " by :  K N O W L E D G E   = " <<  K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E << " %" << endl;
//  
// //	But interesting (and as you'd expect),
//   cout << " by :  A T T I T U D E     = " <<  A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E   << " %" << endl;
// 
// //	But EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO NOTE (or REALIZE), is 
//   cout << " by :  B U L L S H I T     = " <<  B+U+L+L+S+H+I+T   << " %" << endl;
// 
//   cout << endl;
